# Simple eCommerce Website

This is a simple eCommerce platform I built to practice full-stack web development using PHP and MySQL. It allows users to browse products, register an account, and place orders. The system also includes basic admin functionality.

## Project Description

The eCommerce website simulates a basic online store with features like:

- Product listing
- User registration & login
- Shopping cart
- Order placement
- Admin product management

This project helped me understand back-end concepts like handling form data, database operations, and authentication.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (basic)
- PHP
- MySQL (with CRUD operations)
- XAMPP (for local development)

## Features

- User-friendly interface
- User authentication system
- Product database with image upload
- Cart functionality
- Admin panel for product management

## Database

- `mystore.sql` contains the structure and sample data for the project.
- Tables: `users`, `products`, `orders`, etc.

## Screenshots

*(Optional: Include screenshots of the homepage, cart, and admin panel here.)*

## Future Improvements

- Payment gateway integration (e.g., M-PESA)
- Order tracking
- Better product search & filtering
- Enhanced security

## Note

This project is for learning and practice. It is not meant for production use.
